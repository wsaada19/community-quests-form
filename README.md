# **Community Quests Config Form**

A form that can be used to help build quest configurations for the [Community Quests Spigot Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/community-quests-1-16-1-21-%E2%AD%90run-server-wide-quests-%E2%AD%90.90798/.) More information on the plugin and how the configuration setup works can be [found here](https://github.com/wsaada19/CommunityQuests?tab=readme-ov-file#Configuration.).

Built this application to practice using react-hook-form, Material UI and SST for managing infra.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 20** (includes npm)
- **AWS CLI v2** – run `aws configure` before starting

That’s it—everything else installs locally with `npm install`.

## Additional Documentation

Documentation for [SST](https://sst.dev/) and the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/) can be found online.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Bootstrap & run locally
$ npx sst init --bootstrap   # one‑time per AWS account/region
$ npx sst dev                # hot‑reload API + Web
```

Deploy a stage any time:

```bash
npx sst deploy
```

Remove it later with `npx sst remove`
